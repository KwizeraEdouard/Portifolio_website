                      Soon after, his mother moved him to Hawaii to live with his grandfather.
                      Barack Obama was a competent student, but he wasn't exceptional. 
                     Despite the fact that Obama was unable to live with his parents, he pursued his dream. 
                     Finally, he was elected president of a powerful country like the United States.</p> <br>

                      <p>She was born to a single teenage mother on welfare in rural Mississippi. 
                        She felt unwanted and was shuttled back and forth from her grandmother to her mother and then to her father by the time she was 14.
                         She lived in poverty and suffered abuse for years.

                           She was also lonely much of the time and due to her family’s poverty, conditions were poor.
                             But her grandmother taught her to read before she was three years old and she still recalls
                              the positive reception she received when she recited Bible verses at her grandmother’s church.
                              In fact, Oprah had to overcome many challenges and obstacles before achieving the success she enjoys today.
                              She began life on a small farm in Mississippi where her strict grandmother raised her. Despite the hardship 
                              she become one of America’s most influential people 
                              and the first African-American billionaire, and yet it is.

                      <h4>Michel jordan</h4> <br>
                      <p>Michael Jordan was taught by His father to work hard and not to be tempted by street life. 
                        His mother taught him to sew, clean, and do laundry. 
                        Jordan loved sports but failed to make his high school basketball team as a sophomore. 
                        He continued to practice and made the team the next year.</p> <br>
                        <h5>Jordan quoted:</h5> <br>
                        <p><q>Let go of expectations. “If you accept the expectations of others, 
                          especially negative ones, then you never will change the outcome.” 
                          Another great lesson from Michael Jordan is that expectations often get in the way of what we want to achieve in life.
                           And if you let them, they prevent you from moving forward.</q></p>
                           <p><q>I’ve missed more than 9,000 shots in my career.
                              I’ve lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I’ve been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed.
                              I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.</q></p> <br> <br>
